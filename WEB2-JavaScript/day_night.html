        Naver (Hangul: 네이버) is a South Korean online platform operated by Naver Corporation. It debuted in 1999 as the
        first web portal in South Korea to develop and use its own search engine. It was also the world's first operator
        to introduce the comprehensive search feature, which compiles search results from various categories and
        presents them in a single page. Naver has since added a multitude of new services ranging from basic features
        such as e-mail and news to the world's first online Q&A platform Knowledge iN.
        <br><br>
        As of September 2017, the search engine handled 74.7% of all web searches in South Korea and had 42 million
        enrolled users. More than 25 million Koreans have Naver as the start page on their default browser and the
        mobile application has 28 million daily visitors. Naver is also frequently referred to as 'the Google of South
        Korea'
